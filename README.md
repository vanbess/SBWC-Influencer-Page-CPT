## SBWC-Influencer-Page-CPT

This plugin creates a custom post type "influencer_page" which is compatible with Elementor.
- It allows the end-user to create/build influencer pages which hold WooCommerce coupon codes, which are automatically generated on first page publication.
- Coupons are valid for 48 hours.
- WooCommerce is required for this plugin to work.
- Supports Polylang as well.
- Built specifically with Elementor page builder compatibility in mind, but will likely work with other page builders as well, as long as the CSS class ip-coupon-code is applied to all elements which should display the coupon code on the frontend.
